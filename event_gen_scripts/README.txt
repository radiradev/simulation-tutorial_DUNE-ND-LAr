This directory is for the event generation. This folder is in its infancy so there is not much here right now.

The tutorial for ParticleBomb is here: http://deeplearnphysics.org/DLPGenerator/Introduction.html

You have to git clone https://github.com/DeepLearnPhysics/DLPGenerator

ParticleBomb is an event generation tool that can be used as an input for edep-sim via the edep-sim HEPEVT interface (instead of using GEANT4).
